CSS Grid and Flexbox solve different layout problems. Grid is two-dimensional (rows + columns) while Flexbox is one-dimensional. Choose Grid for full-page layouts and Flexbox for linear component layout.

### Examples

- Use Grid for a dashboard with columns and rows.
- Use Flexbox for navbars and small component alignment.
