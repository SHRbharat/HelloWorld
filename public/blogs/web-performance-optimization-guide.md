Performance can make or break your product. This guide walks through measurable improvements you can apply right away: code-splitting, critical CSS, caching headers, and image optimization.

## Quick wins

- Serve optimized images (WebP/AVIF where supported).
- Use caching headers and a CDN.
- Defer non-critical JS and prioritize LCP resources.

## Measuring and monitoring

Use RUM (Real User Monitoring) and synthetic tests to track Core Web Vitals and identify regressions.
